## About Me

Ph.D. in Philosophy from Sapienza University of Rome, where I developed the Multimodal Mind Theory and designed experimental protocols to study Theory of Mind in non-linguistic animals. I currently collaborate as an independent researcher with Sapienza, the Unit of Cognitive Primatology & Primate Center (CNR), and the zoological parks of Rome and Fasano.

I was a visiting scholar at Texas A&M University and Brooklyn College (CUNY), where I carried out research on the relationship between perception, language, and social cognition in non-linguistic animals. My broader interests include rationality, cross-modal integration, and computational models of cognition.

Alongside my academic work, I serve as Chief Research Officer at bitCorp ‚Äì Intelligence Creative Labs, leading R&D in cybersecurity, AI, and cognitive technologies. I am also pursuing a BA in Psychology at the University of Perugia, further grounding my research in empirical methodology.

Beyond my academic work, I‚Äôm also a certified whale watching guide, a dog training educator, and I teach evidence-based acting, combining cognitive science with performative practice.
