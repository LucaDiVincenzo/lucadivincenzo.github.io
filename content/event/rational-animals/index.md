summary: |
  A talk on how multimodal communication reveals insights into Theory of Mind and rationality across species, challenging language-centric assumptions.

abstract: |
  The relationship between rationality and Theory of Mind (ToM) has traditionally been linked to language and approached through unimodal paradigms, often emphasizing vocal communication. However, both human and animal communication systems are inherently multimodal, integrating signals across sensory channels. This shift toward multimodal approaches invites a re-evaluation of how ToM and rationality manifest across species.

  This talk explores the empirical and philosophical implications of this shift. I present two experimental protocols based on multimodal shift—the ability to adapt communication channels in response to environmental constraints—to assess both perception attribution and false-belief understanding in non-human animals. These tasks aim to test whether subjects infer others’ perceptual or belief states under noisy conditions, addressing the challenge of dual interpretation in behavioral data.

  Preliminary findings from a pilot study with two Asian elephants suggest evidence of perception attribution. Ongoing data collection involves eight additional elephants and sixteen capuchin monkeys.

  Building on this, I propose a Multimodal Mind Theory: the idea that cross-modal binding—not language—is central to the development of ToM and rationality. This theory challenges traditional views (e.g., Davidson, Bermúdez) that position language as a necessary condition for higher cognition. I illustrate the implications through two thought experiments, which highlight how multimodal integration supports meta-cognition, rational inference, and mental state attribution.

  Ultimately, this research argues for a more evolutionarily grounded, multimodally-informed understanding of cognition—one that bridges philosophical theory and empirical research across species.
