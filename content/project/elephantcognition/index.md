This study examines whether Asian elephants (*Elephas maximus*) flexibly use different communicative signals depending on the attentional state of a human partner. The project investigates whether elephants can selectively produce visual or auditory gestures according to whether the experimenter is attentive or inattentive—offering insight into their sensitivity to others’ perceptual access and their potential for intentional communication.
